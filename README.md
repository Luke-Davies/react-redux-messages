# Pure React Messages App

A messages app implemented in react and redux.

This app was built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

To start the app in dev mode run `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will run the app on http://localhost:3000

No tests have been added to the default ones generated by create-react-app.

This app is heavily based on the [Todo List Example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos)
